1. Your First Step! 🚀 Let's start by printing a message.

print("Hello World!")  # This prints "Hello World!" to the screen 👋🌍
print("*" * 10)  # This creates a visual separator ✨

Output:
text
Hello World!
**********

What's Happening:

First Line:
🐍 Python sees print( and knows to output something

📝 It reads "Hello World!" - text inside quotation marks

🖥️ It displays this text in your console/terminal

✅ The ) closes the function call

Second Line:
✨ "*" is a string containing one asterisk character

🔁 * 10 tells Python to repeat that string 10 times

📊 So "*" * 10 becomes "**********"

🎯 This creates a nice visual divider in your output!

Now you're coding with style! 😎🐍
